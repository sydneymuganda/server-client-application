A random sample of size 8 from an unknown distribution with a population mean Âµ 
has yielded the following observations:
 0.35 ,1.15, 0.40, 0.08, 0.03, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15 
The sample mean and standard deviation were calculated as 
0.3075 and 0.3642 respectively.The sample averages for each of 1000 bootstrap samples were calculated,
and then ordered from smallest tolargest.The following are some of the ordered results obtained:
________________________________________________
SampleNo:    1   |  10   |  25   | 50   | 100   |
SampleAve: 0.076 | 0.106 | 0.125 |0.139 | 0.163 |
________________________________________________
SampleNo:  900   | 950   | 975   | 990  |  1000 |
SampleAve:0.470  |0.541  |0.579  |0.651 | 0.813 |
